# Inferences from the visualisations:

Sales insights: The sales tends to average at around Rs.818000, however it must be noted that that the sales takes significant dips on Fridays but picks up over the weekends. Sales are higher when promotion offers are available as expected.

Geographic insights: Bengaluru and Hyderabad are the cities with stellar sales,however, they contribute to only 18% of the total sales. Maharashtra tops the list of the states with top sales followed by Karnataka, even though Bengaluru has top sales citywise.

Expenditure trend: Customers tend to usually spend in the range of Rs. 450 and Rs.750 approx per order. 30% of the orders were above said range. Top 3 selling products are Kurtas, Set and Western Dresses. They contribute to 91% of the total sales.

Delivery issues and Return rates:
77% of the orders are yet to be delivered and are in transit, 36% of orders have failed to meet the delivery deadline, this warrants further analysis. 22% of the orders have been delivered. Approximately 1% is being returned to seller. Sarees and sets seem to be the items that are returned most. Bottoms is the most least returned item.

Order Fulfilment Pattern: Sales from Amazon is atleast double than that of Merchant. All return orders were originally sold by Merchants and not Amazon.

Correlation: While amount may increase at times with quantity, overall, there is no linear correlation between quantity and amount. Scatterplot and Heat map confirms the same inference.
